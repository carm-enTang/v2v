            <h1> History </h1>

            <p class="overview">
                No one knows the true history of violins, but it appeared suddenly in a form very similar to the one we know today, in paintings from the 1550s. Two of the oldest violin makers are Andre Amati from Cremona and Gasparo di Bertolotti, both from northern Italy. We also know that Cremona, Italy, was a central area of violin production from the mid 1400s to the first half of the 1600s. Some of the greatest violin makers were from the Amati family, Stradivari family, or Guarneri family.

            <p class="overview">

                The first violins, from the Baroque period, were slightly different from the violins that we know today. The fingerboard and bridge of baroque violins were shorter, and the strings, called gut strings, were made of animal intestines. Modern violins have a longer fingerboard that reaches the middle of the body, which allows for higher hand positions and a higher pitch. The bridge is also taller, which allows for more volume and brightness in tone. Strings are now made of steel, instead of animal intestines, which tended to go out of tune very quickly.
