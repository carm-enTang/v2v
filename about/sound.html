            <p class="overview">
                When the violin is tuned, the pegs are turned. The top of the strings wrap around the pegs, so when the pegs are turned, the strings can be tightened or loosened. Typically, violinists use the pegs to get the strings mostly in tune, then use the fine tuners on the tailpiece to get the string exactly in tune. The tighter the string is, the higher pitch sound it will make.

            </p>


            <p class="overview">
                To produce sound, the bow is drawn across the strings. When the horsehair is dragged across the strings, the friction between the hair and strings cause the string to vibrate, creating sound waves. The violinâ€™s body is hollow, which allows for the reverberation of sound. The thinner strings vibrate more quickly, which in turn produces a higher pitch. Another way pitch is changed is by pressing the string down onto the fingerboard. When fingers are placed on the string, the string is shortened, which also creates a higher pitch. Another way sound can be created is by plucking the string. This technique, called pizzicato, can be done with the bow hand, but it is also possible to be done with the left hand.
