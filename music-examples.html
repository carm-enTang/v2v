                            Bach for solo violin. It is the last piece in his set of Six Sonatas and Partitas. The

                            Paganini's 24 Caprices. It is a widely known piece for solo violin, as it is very
                            technically challenging. It takes about 5 minutes to perform. It is played without accompaniment. </p>

                            Saint-Saëns. It was written for Pablo de Sarasate, a virtuoso violinist friend of
                            Saint-Saëns. The performance time is about 9 minutes, and the soloist can be accompanied
                            by a pianist or an orchestra.

                        <p class="description"> This is Meditation from Thais, an interlude from Jules
                            Massenet's opera, Thais. It is a slow and expressive melodic piece that marks a turning
                            point in the opera. This is an extremely popular solo piece, and is typically part of
                            a violinist’s standard repertoire. Since this piece is so lyrical and expressive, it
                            can be interpreted in various ways, so the performance time varies greatly, from a
                            little less than 5 minutes to over 6 minutes. The soloist can be accompanied by a
                            pianist or an orchestra.

                <p>A quartet is a group of four instrumentalists collaborating to perform a piece. Typically, a string quartet is made of two violins, a viola, and a cello, but there are cases in which violins collaborate with other instruments to produce music.</p>

                        <p class="description"> This is Vivaldi's Concerto in B Minor for 4 Violins. It is an example of a quartet consisting of 4 violins. Each violin takes turn playing the melody and supporting the other three melodies with their own harmonies. Although the video shows a small supporting orchestra, the concerto can be played with just the four violinists.  </p>

                        <p class="description"> This is Dvorak's String Quartet in F major, Op. 96', which is also commonly known as the American' quartet. This quartet is made of two violins, a viola, and a cello. Like the previous quartet, each of the four instrumentalists take turns playing the melody and supporting other melodies. In this case, the violin 1 tends to have much of the melody and the viola often plays the prominent theme, while the violin 2 and cello have more of a support role. </p>

                        <p class="description"> This is Pachebel’s Canon in D. This quartet can be comprised of three violins and a cello, or two violins, a viola, and a cello. The violin 1 starts the melody, and the violin 2 and violin 3/viola come in at different times with the same melody. In this piece, the cello never has the melody, it is a support part that repeats the same eight notes through the entire piece. </p>

                <h3>Orchestras:</h3>
                <p>An orchestra is a large ensemble of instrumentalists, namely of string, woodwind, brass, and percussion players. There is usually a conductor who guides the orchestra to work together as a whole and keeps everyone in sync. They are the ones who dictate the interpretation of the piece and keeps time through conducting.</p>
