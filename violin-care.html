            <h1>Violin Care</h1>
            
            <p> The violin is a very delicate instrument, but if taken care of and maintained, it can withstand the test of time. Listed below are some ways to take care of your instrument and preserve it:</p>

            <div class="container">
                <img src="assets/media/tight.png" alt="Tightening" class="image">
                <div class="overlay">
                    <div class="text"><h3> Bow </h3>
                        <p>In order to work properly, the bow must be tightened so that there is tension in the horsehair. However, after playing, the bow must be loosened in order to keep the bow in good condition. If the bow is constantly tight, the horsehair will be stretched out, which causes the hairs to fall out. Additionally, if the bow is overly tight, it can snap or become warped in shape.</p>
                        
                        <p>
                            The bow should be loosened every time it is not in use and in storage, and tightened before practicing or performance. To loosen the bow, point the tip away from you and turn the screw to the left. When loose, the stick should almost touch the horsehair, and the horsehair should be loose. To tighten, turn the screw right. When tight, the horsehair should be taut, and there should be a slight downward curvature in the stick where the middle of the stick is close to the horsehair, but not touching it.

                        <h3> Temperature & Humidity </h3>
                        <p>The body of the violin is made of wood, which is very susceptible to the weather. In the heat and high humidity, the wood expands and in the cold and low humidity, the wood contracts. This can cause the instrument to quickly go out of tune, as the pegsâ€™ positions will not stay constant. Dryness can also cause the wood to crack and the violin to break apart, as the glue holding it together will have dried out.</p>
                        
                        <p>
                            To avoid extreme changes in the environment, the violin should be kept in the case with a humidifier when not in use and stored in a climate controlled and safe area.
                        
                        </p>

                        <h3> Violin Storage </h3>
                        <p>Slide the bow in tip-first into the left of the case. Secure the bow in place with the latch. Latches may look different; some go in between the horsehair and stick, while some are above or below the slot for the bow. In both cases, the latch should swivel up to be perpendicular to the stick, which is what locks the bow in place. Latches that go in between the horsehair and stick have an axis in the center of the latch, while latches that are above or below the slot for the bow have an axis on one side of the latch.</p>
                        
                        <p>
                        For latches that go between the horsehair and stick, make sure none of the hairs get caught in the latch!</p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Place the violin in the case so the body fits in the big section of the case and the scroll is in the smaller boxy area. The strings should be face up and the violin should be lying on its back, flat in the case. If the case has a neck strap, make sure the neck of the violin is securely strapped in.
                        
                        </p>
