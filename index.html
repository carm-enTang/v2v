            <h1> Introduction </h1>

            <p class="overview">
                The violin is the smallest and highest pitched instrument of the string
                family. It is made of wood and has four strings of varying thickness, which
                produce different pitches when a violin bow is drawn across it. The violin is
                most prominent in classical music, though it is used in other genres as well,
                such as folk, jazz, and pop. When playing, the violinist typically holds the
                violin between their left shoulder and jaw, and uses their left fingers to
                press down on the violin strings. Their right hand holds the bow and moves it
                across the strings to produce sound.

                violin, its role in classical music, how to play the violin and read sheet
                music, and violin care.
